# Churn Data Science Project

## Project Overview: This project began as the final examination of my data science course in the first semester of my masters. Now I have returned to it, I am essentially redoing it and applying many of the more advanced data science and machine learning skills I have learnt as I have been progressing through my masters. I have completed the project both as a Jupyter Notebook and as a group of python files. The Jupyter Notebook contains much more text and explanations of my logic along with various methods, while the python files are a demonstration of my ability to write scalable and modular code.

## Skills Demonstrated:
* Exploratory Analysis
* Data Visualization
* Feature Engineering
* Predictive Modelling
* Hyperparameter Tuning
* Model Selection
* Utilizing model outputs to make a business decision
